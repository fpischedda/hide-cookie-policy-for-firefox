#Hide Cooki Policy

This is a simple stupid Firefox extension that tries to close cookie policy
banners.

It looks for specific elements by id from a list of known ones, so some work
may be needed in order to keep the list up to date.

Future improvements:
* update the list of ids at runtime by the user
* share the list of ids between users
* auto update the list when new entries are available
